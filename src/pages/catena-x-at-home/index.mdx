# Overview

Catena-X@Home is a walkthrough through all essential Catena-X services. 
The target users for Catena-X are developers and architects who want to learn the concepts and try it out by their own.

# What You Will Learn

In this guide, you will learn as **Data Provider** how to:

 - Create sample submodel data
 - Create an Eclipse Data Space Connector Assets and Contract Definition 
 - Make your submodel data discoverable with Digital Twins and the Digital Twin Registry

and as **Data Consumer**:
 - Search for digital twins in the Digital Twin Registry
 - Request data using Eclipse Data Space Connectors and digital twins as data consumer

## Prerequisits

Before starting this guide, you will need:

 - Tools Installed: [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/), [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
 - GitHub Presonal Access Token: [GitHub](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with `read:packages` permissions. You need the access token to download the docker images.
    
## Setup

In this section we will start the Catena-X Core services as docker containers. 

1. Clone the repository [Catena-X](https://github.com/catenax/tractusx):
   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/catenax/tractusx.git
   ```
2. Open a terminal and run:
    ```bash 
    cd tractusx/eclipsedataspaceconnector/api-wrapper
    ```
3. Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` with your token and run: 
    ```bash 
    export GITHUB_TOKEN=<YOUR_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>
    ```
4. To start all relevant docker containers run:
  ```bash 
    docker-compose up -d
  ```
5. Verify that the docker containers are running:
  ```bash 
    docker ps
  ```
6. The setup is now complete! In the next sections we will interact with the services.



## End-to-End Use Case

The interaction diagram below shows the complete interactions that we will go through.

![End-To-End interaction](/img/catena-x-at-home/sequence-end-to-end.png)

:::note
In the upcoming sections we will go through each of the relevant steps and explain 

To **try out the the End-to-End** use case you need to import the Postman collection:

[![Open in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/f2c6068bddb1f72263fd?action=collection%2Fimport)

The Postman collection contains all relevant requests from the above diagram.

### Register EDC assets and Digital Twins

In this section we will focus on the steps that a **Data Provider** has to follow.


<details>
    <summary>
      Actor: Data Provider 
    </summary>
    <div>
      The data provider registers AAS Descriptors and Submodel Descriptors so that consumers 
      can query for AAS Descriptors and request data via the Submodel Descriptor Endpoints.   
    </div>

</details>

<Spacer/>

#### Step 1: Create Sample Material Data


<details>
    <summary>
      What is a Submodel Server
    </summary>
    <div>
      A Submodel Server is a service that serves data that you want to make available to data consumers.
      Almost all organizations do have their own structure for their data. Hence, Data Providers will likely implement their own
      Submodel Servers that mainly map their own structure into Catena-X defined Semantic Models. 
      <p><b>Being compliant with a Semantic Model is the only requirement for a Submodel Server. </b></p>
    </div>

</details>


For the purpose of the demonstration we created a trivial Submodel Server that is compliant with the Semantic Model Traceability.

The first request creates a Traceability data. Our final goal is to make this data available to data consumers.

:::note Action
Plese run the request `1. Create Sample Data` of the **Postman** collection to create a data entry.
:::

You now created traceability data that we can use to share.

#### Step 2: Create an EDC Asset

<details>
    <summary>
      What is an EDC Asset
    </summary>
    <div>
       TBD: Explanation by the EDC Team needed
    </div>
</details>

The request payload to create an EDC Asset is:

```json
{
  "asset": {
    "properties": {
      // {{digitalTwinId}}-{{digitalTwinSubmodelId}}
      // highlight-next-line
      "asset:prop:id": "urn:uuid:365e6fbe-bb34-11ec-8422-0242ac120002-urn:uuid:61125dc3-5e6f-4f4b-838d-447432b97918",
      "asset:prop:name": "product description",
      "asset:prop:contenttype": "application/json",
      "asset:prop:policy-id": "use-eu"
    }
  },
  "dataAddress": {
    "properties": {
      // {{digitalTwinSubmodelId}}
      // highlight-next-line
      "endpoint": "http://provider-backend-service:8080/data/urn:uuid:61125dc3-5e6f-4f4b-838d-447432b97918",
      "type": "HttpData"
    }
  }
}
```

The most relevant part of the edc payload are the fields `assetDto#asset:prop:id` and `dataAddressDto:endpoint`.

Field | Description
--- | --- |
`asset#properties#asset:prop:id` | The value of this field has to match the following pattern **<DIGITAL_TWIN_ID>-<DIGITAL_TWIN_SUBMODEL_ID>**. The Digital Twin Registry allows you to set the ids by yourself. You can generate the ids (UUIDv4) for the EDC Asset and use the same ids to create the Digital Twin and Submodel in the Digital Twin Registry. For an example, please have a look at the Postman collection.|
`dataAddress#properties#endpoint` | This is the URL of your submodel server that provides the data we created in **Step 1**. You are free to define the URL by your own. The only requirement is that it returns the requested data for the Digital Twins submodel.** |



:::note Action
Plese run the request `2. Create an EDC Asset` of the **Postman** collection.

#### Step 3: Create an EDC policy

<details>
    <summary>
      What is an EDC policy
    </summary>
    <div>
       TBD: Explanation by the EDC Team needed
    </div>

</details>

The request payload to create an EDC policy is:

```json
{
  // {{edcPolicyId}}
  "uid": "231802-bb34-11ec-8422-0242ac120002",
  "permissions": [
    {
      // {{digitalTwinId}}-{{digitalTwinSubmodelId}}
      // highlight-next-line 
      "target": "urn:uuid:365e6fbe-bb34-11ec-8422-0242ac120002-urn:uuid:61125dc3-5e6f-4f4b-838d-447432b97918",
      "action": {
        "type": "USE"
      },
      "edctype": "dataspaceconnector:permission"
    }
  ],
  "@type": {
    "@policytype": "set"
  }
}
```

Field | Description
--- | --- |
`permissions[0]#target` | Must match the EDC asset id `asset#properties#asset:prop:id`.|

:::note Action
Plese run the request `3. Create an EDC policy` of the **Postman** collection.
:::

#### Step 4: Create a EDC contract definition

<details>
    <summary>
      What is an EDC contract definition
    </summary>
    <div>
       TBD: Explanation by the EDC Team needed
    </div>

</details>

The request payload for the creating an EDC contract definition is:

```json
{
  "id": "1",
  // {{edcPolicyId}}
  // highlight-next-line
  "accessPolicyId": "231802-bb34-11ec-8422-0242ac120002",
  // {{edcPolicyId}}
  // highlight-next-line
  "contractPolicyId": "231802-bb34-11ec-8422-0242ac120002",
  "criteria": []
}
```

Field | Description
--- | --- |
`accessPolicyId` | Must match the EDC policy uuid. |
`contractPolicyId` | **TBD: Is this correct?** Must match the EDC policy uuid. |


:::note Action
Plese run the request `3. Create an EDC Contract definition` of the **Postman** collection.

#### Step 5: Register digital twin with a reference to submodel data

The Digital Twin Registry is like an address book. By registering a digital twin you enable data consumers access your data.
The payload for the creation of a digital twin is:

```json
{
    // "description" omitted
    "globalAssetId": {
        "value": [
            // highlight-next-line
            "{{digitalTwinId}}"
        ]
    },
    "idShort": "BMW 520e Plugin-Hybrid",
    // urn:uuid:365e6fbe-bb34-11ec-8422-0242ac120002
    // highlight-next-line
    "identification": "urn:uuid:365e6fbe-bb34-11ec-8422-0242ac120002",
    // highlight-next-line
    "specificAssetIds": [
        {
            "key": "PartNumber",
            "value": "31BK"
        },
        {
            "key": "VAN",
            "value": "7e97f714-0785-3f9d-ac37-b31989097be3"
        }
    ],
    "submodelDescriptors": [
        {
            // "description" omitted
            "idShort": "traceability",
            // {{digitalTwinSubmodelId}}
            // highlight-next-line
            "identification": "urn:uuid:61125dc3-5e6f-4f4b-838d-447432b97918",
            "semanticId": {
                "value": [
                    // highlight-next-line
                    "urn:bamm:com.catenax.battery.product_description:1.0.1#ProductDescription"
                ]
            },
            "endpoints": [
                {
                    "interface": "SUBMODEL-1.0RC02",
                    "protocolInformation": {
                        // {{providerControlPlaneDockerInternal}}/{{digitalTwinId}}-{{digitalTwinSubmodelId}}
                        // highlight-next-line
                        "endpointAddress": "edc://provider-control-plane:8080/urn:uuid:365e6fbe-bb34-11ec-8422-0242ac120002-urn:uuid:61125dc3-5e6f-4f4b-838d-447432b97918/submodel?content=value&extent=withBlobValue",
                        "endpointProtocol": "IDS/ECLIPSE DATASPACE CONNECTOR",
                        "endpointProtocolVersion": "0.0.1-SNAPSHOT"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Field | Description
--- | --- |
`globalAssetId#value[0]` | The global asset id is meant to be identify a physical asset uniquely. The MAC-Address a reald world example. In the manufactoring world such a global asset id does not yet exists. Therefore the value here must be equal to the digital twin id (#identification).  |
`specificAssetIds` | Your digital twin can be searched for by specific asset ids. |
`identification` | The uuid you can set by yourself. |
`submodeldescriptors[0]#identification` | The uuid you can set by yourself. |
`submodeldescriptors[0]#semanticId[0]#value` | The urn of the Semantic Model. The Semantic Model describes the structure of the data your submodel endpoint returns. It is the structure definition that a data consumer expects when calling your submodel endoint.|
`submodeldescriptors[0]#endpoints[0]#protocolInformation#endpointAddress` | The URL must be structured as in the example above. The URL contains the asset id (**<DIGITAL_TWIN_ID>-<DIGITAL_TWIN_SUBMODEL_ID>**) which is used to filter for a an EDC Asset to get the endpoint of your submodel endpoint in `dataAddress#properties#endpoint`. |
